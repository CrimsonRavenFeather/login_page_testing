Test Scenarios: The project includes various test scenarios to cover different login scenarios such as successful login, invalid credentials, locked accounts, and more.
Validation: The project verifies the correctness of the login process by comparing expected outcomes with the actual results obtained from the web application.
Reporting: The project generates detailed reports containing information about the executed test cases, including success and failure statuses, along with any relevant error messages or exceptions encountered during the test execution.
Logging: The project implements logging functionality to capture important events and information during the test execution, aiding in debugging and troubleshooting.

Prerequisites : 
Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
Selenium: Install the Selenium library using pip.

Usage :

Modify the configuration file to provide the necessary credentials or configuration details required for the login testing.
